  - change the respective lines in definitions.make
  - include the headers in Math/Blas.hh and Math/Lapack.hh

COMPILATION
===========

* adjust paths in definitions.make:
  - OPENCVROOT path to your OpenCV includes and libraries
  - MKLROOT    path to your Intel MKL includes and libraries
               (or to another Blas/Lapack implementation you use)
* call "make" in the src directory
